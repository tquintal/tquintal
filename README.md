## Hi there, I'm Tomás! 👋

I'm a front-end developer dedicated to turning designs into functional and optimized solutions. With expertise in ReactJS, TypeScript, and NextJS, I've been involved in various team projects, highlighting one where I worked full-stack, from conception to implementation, using the T3 Stack technologies.

## Experience and Skills

- 💻 Technologies: JavaScript/TypeScript, ReactJS, NextJS, TailwindCSS, tRPC, Prisma, SQL, Git, HTML5, CSS3, Adobe Suite, C#
- 🌐 Recently, I've been engaged in 5 projects, including 2 international ones. I particularly emphasize one project where I had a full-stack contribution.

## Future Goals

I'm committed to continuously enhancing my front-end development skills and also exploring the back-end domain. Always eager to learn new technologies and development practices.
