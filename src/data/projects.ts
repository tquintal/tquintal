      "üåê This project is a Next.js application created to serve as a portfolio website for my sister.\n\nüîê I have successfully implemented a login system using NextAuth.\n\nüé® Additionally, I have integrated interface elements to enable dynamic content editing. This is facilitated by Prisma ORM, allowing for efficient database interactions and data modeling.\n\nüöÄ Furthermore, these features have been implemented using tRPC, a framework for building type-safe APIs. This ensures robust communication between the front-end and back-end, enhancing the overall performance and reliability of the application.\n\nüîó Learn more about the project's development at the following link: https://github.com/tquintal/call-to-consciousness/",
